//! Various diff (longest common subsequence) algorithms.
//!
//! The implementations of the algorithms in this module are relatively low
//! level and expose the most generic bounds possible for the algorithm.  To
//! use them you would typically use the higher level API if possible but
//! direct access to these algorithms can be useful in some cases.
//!
//! All these algorithms provide a `diff` function which takes two indexable
//! objects (for instance slices) and a [`DiffHook`].  As the
//! diff is generated the diff hook is invoked.  Note that the diff hook does
//! not get access to the actual values but only the indexes.  This is why the
//! diff hook is not used outside of the raw algorithm implementations as for
//! most situations access to the values is useful of required.
//!
//! The algorithms module really is the most low-level module in similar and
//! generally not the place to start.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This is a simple example that shows how you can calculate the difference
//! between two sequences and capture the ops into a vector.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use similar::algorithms::{Algorithm, Replace, Capture, diff_slices};
//!
//! let a = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let b = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 7];
//! let mut d = Replace::new(Capture::new());
//! diff_slices(Algorithm::Myers, &mut d, &a, &b).unwrap();
//! let ops = d.into_inner().into_ops();
//! ```
//!
//! The above example is equivalent to using
//! [`capture_diff_slices`](crate::capture_diff_slices).
