//! Text diffing utilities.
//!
//! This provides helpful utilities for text (and more specifically line) diff
//! operations.  The main type you want to work with is [`TextDiff`] which
//! uses the underlying diff algorithms to expose a convenient API to work with
//! texts.
//!
//! It can produce a unified diff and also let you iterate over the changeset
//! directly if you want.
//!
//! Text diffing is available by default but can be disabled by turning off the
//! default features.  The feature to enable to get it back is `text`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A super simple example for how to generate a unified diff with three lines
//! off context around the changes:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use similar::text::TextDiff;
//! # let old_text = "";
//! # let new_text = "";
//! let diff = TextDiff::from_lines(old_text, new_text);
//! let unified_diff = diff.unified_diff().header("old_file", "new_file").to_string();
//! ```
//!
//! This is another example that iterates over the actual changes:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use similar::text::TextDiff;
//! # let old_text = "";
//! # let new_text = "";
//! let diff = TextDiff::from_lines(old_text, new_text);
//! for op in diff.ops() {
//!     for change in diff.iter_changes(op) {
//!         println!("{:?}", change);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Ops vs Changes
//!
//! Because very commonly two compared sequences will largely match this module
//! splits it's functionality into two layers.  The first is inherited from the
//! general [`algorithms`](crate::algorithms) module: changes are encoded as
//! [diff operations](crate::algorithms::DiffOp).  These are ranges of the
//! differences by index in the source sequence.  Because this can be cumbersome
//! to work with a separate method [`TextDiff::iter_changes`] is provided which
//! expands all the changes on an item by item level encoded in an operation.
//!
//! Because the [`TextDiff::grouped_ops`] method can isolate clusters of changes
//! this even works for very long files if paired with this method.
//!
//! # Trailing Newlines
//!
//! When working with line diffs (and unified diffs in general) there are two
//! "philosophies" to look at lines.  One is to diff lines without their newline
//! character, the other is to diff with the newline character.  Typically the
//! latter is done because text files do not _have_ to end in a newline character.
//! As a result there is a difference between `foo\n` and `foo` as far as diffs
//! are concerned.
//!
//! In similar this is handled on the [`Change`] or [`InlineChange`] level.  If
//! a diff was created via [`TextDiff::from_lines`] the text diffing system is
//! instructed to check if there are missing newlines encountered.  If that is
//! the case the [`Change`] object will return true from the
//! [`Change::missing_newline`] method so the caller knows to handle this by
//! either rendering a virtual newline at that position or to indicate it in
//! different ways.  For instance the unified diff code will render the special
//! `\ No newline at end of file` marker.
//!
//! # Bytes vs Unicode
//!
//! This module concerns itself with a loser definition of "text" than you would
//! normally see in Rust.  While by default it can only operate on [`str`] types
//! by enabling the `bytes` feature it gains support for byte slices with some
//! caveats.
//!
//! A lot of text diff functionality assumes that what is being diffed constiutes
//! text, but in the real world it can often be challenging to ensure that this is
//! all valid utf-8.  Because of this the crate is built so that most functinality
//! also still works with bytes for as long as they are roughtly ASCII compatible.
//!
//! This means you will be successful in creating a unified diff from latin1
//! encoded bytes but if you try to do the same with EBCDIC encoded bytes you
//! will only get garbage.
